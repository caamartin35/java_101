    <li><b><a name="Simple_Calculator">Simple Calculator</a><br>
    </b>For this question, you are to write a simple calculator:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply right click on the demo (simpleCalcDemo.jar) in IntelliJ and click 'Run simpleCalcDemo.jar' to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
        To complete this question:<ol>
            <li>Run the demo program (simpleCalcDemo.jar), which shows
                how this program should work once it is completed.</li>
            <li>Take a look at SimpleCalculator.java. This
                file contains most of the solution already written for you, making your job
                much easier.&nbsp; It also contains the specifics for the assignment, so you
                really must start from this file.</li>
            <li>Read the comments at the head of the SimpleCalculator.java file.&nbsp; Read
                them <i>very carefully</i>!</li>
            <li>Find each @TODO in the SimpleCalculator.java file -- these explain each
                step in the assignment.&nbsp; There are 16 steps, but most are fairly simple
                (though a few might be a bit more challenging).<br>
                <i>Hint:&nbsp; the program says it passes all tests now, but that's only
                    because the tests themselves are very incomplete!&nbsp; Part of your
                    assignment is to write reasonable tests!</i></li><br>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b><a name="Bonus/Optional:_Simple_Calculator_Extensions">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Bonus/Optional</span>: Simple
        Calculator Extensions</a><br>
    </b>Here are two extensions you may add to the simple calculator for bonus.&nbsp;
        If you plan to do these, first commit your regular calculator solution to git.
        This way, if you screw this up beyond belief, you wont lose all the work you did before.<ol>
            <li><b>Backspace<br>
            </b>Add the ability for the user to enter a backspace, which undoes the last
                letter typed.&nbsp; The user should be able to backspace multiple times,
                back through the equals sign (if entered), back through the right-hand side,
                back through the operator, and finally back through the left-hand side.&nbsp;
                If the user enters backspace with no left-hand side, an error message should
                be displayed.<br>
                Hint:&nbsp; JComponentWithEvents defines the BACK_SPACE constant, which you
                can use to test the key against in the keyPressed() method.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            <li><b>Two Operators with Precedence<br>
            </b>Add the ability to handle expressions with two operators, such as
                "1+2*3=".&nbsp; You should respect order of operations, so "1+2*3="
                evaluates to 7, but "1*2+3=" evaluates to 5.&nbsp; You should also still
                support just one operator, as in "1+2=".</li><br>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b><a name="Animations">Animations</a><br>a. Bouncing Ball and
        Square<br></b>In the file BouncingBallAndSquare.java<b>, </b>write the
        animation found in the BouncingBallAndSquare.jar file. Right click that
        file in IntelliJ and select 'Run BouncingBallAndSquare.jar'. When you create
        your BouncingBallAndSquare class, you will need to create a main method and
        run configuration in order to run it. You will also need to do this for the
        BallAroundSquare. You can click 'edit configurations' and see how the 'Calculator'
        one works and replicate it. Don't pay attention to the JAR configurations, they are put there automatically
        by IntelliJ when you run a JAR file.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Notes:<ul>
            <li>The ball and square move at different speeds.</li>
            <li>Each bounces as it hits the edges (they do not go even partially
                past the edges)</li>
            <li>Each changes color depending on the direction it is moving</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>b.&nbsp; Ball Around Square<br>
        </b>In the file BallAroundSquare.java<b>, </b>write the animation in
            the ballAroundSquare.jar file. Right click that file in IntelliJ and select
            'Run ballAroundSquare.jar'<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            Notes:</p><ul>
            <li>The blue box is the largest square you can draw with a 10-pixel
                margin around it (so you will take the minimum of the width and height
                when computing the size of the square)</li>
            <li>The circle pauses on the corners and is red while it pauses.</li>
            <li>Hint:&nbsp; the animation itself does not pause when the circle is on the
                corner -- <b>the timer keeps firing away as normal</b>.&nbsp; Only your logic
                must basically <i>ignore</i> the timer for a little while at the right
                times.&nbsp; To do this, perhaps you might introduce a counter (maybe
                called the "pauseCounter") that is set to 0 when you are <i>not</i>
                paused.&nbsp; When you want to pause, set the counter to some positive
                value (say, 10, to start).&nbsp; Now, when timerFired is called, if your
                pause counter is positive, just decrement it and return immediately.&nbsp;
                Thus, you will ignore some number (again, say 10, to start) of calls to
                timerFired, and only when the pauseCounter reaches 0 will you again
                start processing the timer events.</li>
            <li>Also, you will want to use the page.drawString method to draw the
                text.&nbsp; It takes 3 parameters -- a String, and an x and y location
                at which to draw the string.&nbsp; The x is the left edge of the string
                and the y is the "baseline", which is near the bottom of the string.&nbsp;
                For example, try this line of code:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; page.drawString("Carpe diem", 50, 100);<br>
                Then, read the online API for the drawString method in the Graphics class for
                more details.</li>
            <li>You will also want to use the substring method of the String class.&nbsp;
                This method takes 2 parameters -- the starting index (inclusive) and the
                ending index (exclusive), and returns the substring between them.&nbsp;
                For example, "abcdefg".substring(2,5) returns the string "cde". </li>
            <li>Another hint:&nbsp; you may want to draw two strings, one per
                visible line, using different substrings of a third string.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
