        </b>Add the following features to the game of
            Snake provided in Snake.java</p><ol>
        <li><b>Multiple moves per timer event<br>
        </b>As written, the snake only moves on timer events.&nbsp; So, for example,
            if you hit RIGHT then UP very quickly (in less time than a single timer
            event delay), then the snake will not go right then up, but only up (the
            last direction pressed).&nbsp; Fix this so that you can rapidly make several
            moves between timer fired events.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Snake traps<br>
        </b>Snake traps work just like food, only they are painted red instead of
            green, and the snake dies if it crawls into one.&nbsp; Also, each time the
            snake eats another morsel of food, another snake trap is placed randomly
            somewhere (so at first there is one snake trap visible, then two, then
            three,...).<b><br>

            In the file Lab6SnakeBonus.java, add the following additional features to
            the game of Snake that we wrote in class:</p><ol>
        <li><b>Simple features<br>
        </b>(do whichever you like -- each is worth 1/2 point up to 3 points max, if
            done really well)<ul>
                <li>A score.</li>
                <li>A countdown timer.</li>
                <li>Multiple snake lives.</li>
                <li>A high score file.</li>
                <li>A splash screen (at the start of the program) and a game over
                    screen.</li>
                <li>A help screen.<br>
                    &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>More challenging features<br>
        </b>(each worth 1 point up to 6 points max, if done really well)<ul>
            <li>Impediments (walls, traps, etc).</li>
            <li>Eagles (they attack and eat snakes).</li>
            <li>Portals (as the snake enters a portal, it magically teletransports
                to emerge from a different portal, so for a while there are two partial
                snakes on the board)</li>
            <li>Two players (one gets arrows, the other gets AWSZ or some such).</li>
            <li>Significantly better graphics and sounds.</li>
            <li>Levels with increasing challenges (faster play, more impediments,
                smarter eagles, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
        <p>Be creative!!!&nbsp; Have fun!!!</p></li>
