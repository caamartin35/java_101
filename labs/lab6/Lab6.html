            Snake provided in Snake.java</p><ol>
        <li><b>Multiple moves per timer event<br>
        </b>As written, the snake only moves on timer events.&nbsp; So, for example,
            if you hit RIGHT then UP very quickly (in less time than a single timer
            event delay), then the snake will not go right then up, but only up (the
            last direction pressed).&nbsp; Fix this so that you can rapidly make several
            moves between timer fired events.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Snake traps<br>
        </b>Snake traps work just like food, only they are painted red instead of
            green, and the snake dies if it crawls into one.&nbsp; Also, each time the
            snake eats another morsel of food, another snake trap is placed randomly
            somewhere (so at first there is one snake trap visible, then two, then
            three,...).<b><br>

            <span style="background-color: #99FF66">Transpose Musical Notes</span></a><br>
        </b>In order to have an interesting application of arrays, we will use a
            simple musical note player.&nbsp; First, take a look a musicalNotePlayer/MusicalNotePlay.java.
            Run it, listen to the results.&nbsp; Now, look inside that file.&nbsp; You will
            see a method with this signature:<br>
            <font color="#800000" face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp; public static void
                playNotes(int[] notes, int[] times) throws Exception {<br>
                &nbsp; }</font><br>
            Here is a simple explanation of how this works, taken from the header
            comment in the file:<br>
            <font color="#800000" face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp; // Simple demo of a
                simple musical note player.<br>
                &nbsp; // It takes two arrays -- one containing the notes, the other
                containing the times for each note.<br>
                &nbsp; // For the notes, 60 is middle C.&nbsp; 61 is C# (the next note).&nbsp; 62 is D
                (the note after that).<br>
                &nbsp; // Legal note range:&nbsp; 1 to 88 (inclusive)<br>
                &nbsp; // For the times, 64 is a typical quarter note, 256 a typical whole
                note.<br>
                &nbsp; // Legal time range:&nbsp; 1 to 256 (inclusive)<br>
                &nbsp; // If the "times" array is null, it will play all quarter notes.</font><br>
            You do <i>not</i> need to understand music theory in order to complete
            this exercise.&nbsp; However, the methods you write here will create arrays
            of integers which can be used as arguments to the "playNotes" method.&nbsp;
            So you can <i>hear</i> your results!&nbsp; Fun!<br>
            <br>
            Now, in the file Lab6.java, write the method:<br>
            <font color="#800000" face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp; public static int[]
                transposeNotes(int[] notes, int step) {<br>
                &nbsp; }</font><br>
            This method makes a song higher-pitched or lower-pitched.&nbsp; This method
            takes a non-null array of notes (as described above), and another int,
            the "step", and returns a new array of notes where each note in the
            resulting "transposed" array equals the corresponding note in the
            original array plus the (possibly-negative) step.&nbsp; There is this
            exception, however:&nbsp; in no case shall you transpose so that any notes
            fall outside of the legal range of [1,88].&nbsp; In such a case, you should
            reduce the step's magnitude by just enough to keep the transposed result
            in range.&nbsp; For example, if the highest note in the incoming array is 80,
            and the step is +10, then you should reduce the step to +8.&nbsp; Similarly,
            if the lowest note in the incoming array is 8, and the step is -10, you
            should change the step to be -7.&nbsp; Be sure to include an appropriate test
            method!&nbsp; Also, for fun, try transposing the sample song in the
            MusicalNotePlayer, perhaps as such:<br>
            <font color="#800000" face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp; for (int step=0;
                step &lt; 12; step++)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; playNotes(transpose(songNotes,step), songTimes); // a familiar
                song, now transposed repeatedly</font><br>
            You should hear the song played repeatedly, increasing its pitch by a
            little bit (one-half step) each time it plays.<br>

		Scrabble Score</span></a><br>
        </b>In the game of Scrabble, players receive points for spelling words,
            where each letter has an associated point value (1 for A, 3 for B, 3 for
            C, 2 for D, and so on...).&nbsp; For example, ignoring special squares (which
            we will), the word "CAB" is worth 3+1+3, or 7 points.&nbsp; For more details,

                scrabbleScore(String s, int[] letterValues)</font><b><br>
            </b>This method takes a String s and an array of 26 integers
            representing point values of the letters from A to Z in order, and
            returns the sum of the point values for each letter in the string.&nbsp; If
            the string is null or empty or if it contains any characters besides
            uppercase letters, or if the letterValues array is null or not of length
            26, the result should be -1 to indicate an error.<br>
            <br>
            If you are interested, here is an array holding the actual letter values
            for the English-language version of Scrabble:<br>

            <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; The letterValues array may contain point values besides
            the official point values (say, 25 for 'A', 18 for 'B', -33 for 'C', and
            so on).&nbsp; Your method must work for whatever letterValues array is

        </b>Say that you are taking a multiple choice test with 10 questions
            each with 4 choices.&nbsp; If you guess randomly on every question, what
            are the odds that you score 7/10?&nbsp; According to this page (<a href="http://www.mathwords.com/b/bernoulli_trials.htm">http://www.mathwords.com/b/bernoulli_trials.htm</a>),
            for example, you can use the Binomial Probability Formula over Bernoulli

            you should draw each character individually, using drawCenteredString,
            with the characters initially equally-spaced across the screen.&nbsp;
            Then, with each timer fired, shift the characters one to the left

            A's (90-100), B's (80-89), C's (70-79), D's (60-69), or F's (0-59).&nbsp;
            You must label the entire histogram and also label the x axis (the
            grades), but you do not have to label the y axis (# of students) (why is
            this more difficult to do well?).<br>
            <br>
            For example, you might produce a histogram like this:<br>

            <img border="0" src="steelersLogo.gif" width="184" height="184"><br>
            <br>
            To do this, you must create a new BufferedImage, then draw the Steelers
            logo into that image using nothing but drawLine, fillOval,
            fillRect, drawCenteredString, setFont, setColor.<br>
            <br>
            As a first step, you must write this exact helper method:<br>
            <font color="#800000" face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp; public static void
                fillAstroid(Graphics page, Color color, int cx, int cy, int r)</font><br>
            This method takes a page, a color, a center point (cx,cy), and a radius,
            and draws a single filled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroid">
                astroid</a> (the type of hypocycloid in the Steelers logo) in the given
            color that is just contained by the circle with the given center and
            radius.&nbsp; Do this as follows:<br>
            <br>
            1.&nbsp; Draw "x" and "y" axes centered inside the circle.<br>
            2.&nbsp; Place n evenly-spaced points along each of the x and y axes.&nbsp; (You
            do not have to actually draw these points, but you will use them in the
            next step...)<br>
            3.&nbsp; In the first quadrant:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Draw a line from (0, n) to (1, 0)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (That is, from the highest point on the y-axis to the first
            point to the right on the x-axis)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Draw a line from (0, n-1) to (2, 0)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (That is, from the <i>second highest</i> point on the y-axis
            to the second point to the right on the x-axis)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * And so on (as you move down the y axis, you move right on the x
            axis).&nbsp; Of course, you must use a loop to draw all these lines!<br>
            4. Do the same for the other three quadrants.<br>
            <br>
            Here is a picture of an astroid drawn in this manner, with about 10
            points on each positive or negative coordinate axis:<br>
            <img border="0" src="partialAstroid.gif" width="231" height="230"><br>
            To a limit, the more points you use, the more filled-in the astroid
            becomes.&nbsp; Your method must use enough points-per-axis so that the
            astroid looks to be entirely solid.&nbsp; Curiously, due to roundoff errors,
            using too many points-per-axis might have the counterintuitive effect of
            making the astroid appear less filled in!&nbsp; Find a good number by trial
            and error. <br>
            <br>
            Note:&nbsp; while you should be very close, you do not have to be
            pixel-perfect in this problem.&nbsp; Also, your font does not have to

            (and you may <i>not</i> write the other one for bonus; instead, try one
            of the bonus problems in the Challenge section!).&nbsp; Your choice, but
            if you choose Othello, which is a bit harder, you will receive +5 bonus
            points.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Connect4 Option:<br>
            </b>In a file named Lab6Connect4.java, write the game of Connect4 provided in connect4.jar<br>
            To play the game:&nbsp; Two players alternate turns dropping pieces (using
            the left, right, and down or space keys) in columns.&nbsp; First player to
            get 4-in-a-row wins that game.&nbsp; If the board fills up, that game is a
            tie.&nbsp; Play the game a bit to understand the rest of the design spec.&nbsp;
            The game IS the design spec, so your games should match its behavior
            (though you do not have to be "pixel perfect" -- just "very close").&nbsp;
            For more details, here is the Wikipedia page on Connect4:<b><br>
            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">

            <br>
            <b>Othello/Reversi Option:<br>
            </b>In a file named Lab6Othello.java, write a two-player game of Othello
            (also known as Reversi).&nbsp; If you do not know how to play this game, the
            rules are simple and it is quick to learn (though hard to master).&nbsp; You
            can learn about the game at the Wikipedia page:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi</a><br>
            You can also play the game against a computer by searching for "Othello
            Applet" in the search engine of your choice.&nbsp; (Of course, it is also
            possible to find some Java source code for Othello by a similar search,
            but that is most definitely not allowed!&nbsp; Write the code yourself, and
            do not look at anyone else's implementation!!!)<br>
            <br>
            Your program will not play against a person.&nbsp; Instead, it will support
            two people playing each other, in the same manner as the sample Connect4
            game in the previous section.&nbsp; Your program should not allow illegal
            moves, however.&nbsp; It should also automatically pass if a player has no
            legal moves, and automatically end the game when neither player has a
            legal move.&nbsp; Keep score and provide a generally pleasing and easy-to-use
            UI (again, check the Connect4 sample program to gauge what we mean,
            though you have the freedom to design this however you want).&nbsp; Have fun
            with it! <br>

            <b>Note</b>:&nbsp; for 3/4-credit on this problem, you can skip the
            animation and instead just draw the non-animated picture shown below.<br>
            <br>
            In any case, your reproduction does not need to be perfect, but should
            be reasonably close (hopefully enough to generate the optical illusion).&nbsp;
            For example, here is a snapshot of our reasonable-enough solution:<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="Lab6MotionAftereffectScreenShot.GIF" width="304" height="317"><br>
            <br>
            You also do not need to include any of the buttons or otherwise let the user
            adjust anything -- just use values close to the default values.&nbsp;
            You should, however, include the Buddha picture (or some other suitable picture),
            though, since that is important to see the illusion that the picture is
            expanding/contracting (it's not)).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Hint</b>:&nbsp; use fillArc extensively!&nbsp; Our solution called
            fillArc well over 200 times to draw the picture above -- once for each
            individual segment.&nbsp; Now, we didn't draw segments, but arcs, so we
            had to draw the arcs in a specific order so they hid portions of
            previous arcs, leaving behind the segments you see now.<br>

                    should call System.currentTimeMillis() at the start of your method,
