        Tetris Extensions<br>
    </b>Extend your Tetris implementation in interesting and compelling ways that
    (a) make the game more fun for players and (b) show off your hard-won
    programming skills.&nbsp; Read part 8 of the Tetris notes for ideas, though you are
    not limited to these suggestions.&nbsp; To receive proper credit, be sure to add a
    comment at the header of your Java program clearly listing each bonus feature
    you added, and also listing the total # of hours you invested in bonus (with the
    usual bonus rules applying).&nbsp; Also:&nbsp; please obtain instructor approval before
    going beyond 5 hours of bonus time on this assignment (this is not to discourage
    you (no!), but to be sure that all that time is invested in appropriate and
    credit-worthy activity).&nbsp; Be creative!&nbsp; Have fun!!!</p>
